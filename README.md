    Hi there, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-pimentel-fuoco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pedro Fuoco</a>
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I'm a Mechatronical Engineer with lots of intrest in robotics, embedded systems and IoT
</h2>

<p>
    I've been the head of software development at the University of São Paulo's autonomous drones team, where I fell in love with code that comes to life through sensors and actuators. There's nothing like developing software/firmware that will fly right in front of you! This was also my first contact with open source projects, another growing passion of mine.
</p>

<p>
    After achieving first place in two robotics national competitions (Competição Brasileira de Robótica 2021/2022) I started focusing more in open source contributions and exploring new areas.
    I'm currently developping my skills on firmware engineering, working mainly with freeRTOS, as well as IoT connectivity.
