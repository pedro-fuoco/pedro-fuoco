    Hi there, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-pimentel-fuoco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pedro Fuoco</a>
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I'm a Mechatronical Engineer with lots of intrest in robotics, embedded systems and IoT
</h2>

<p>
    I've been the software development captain of the University of SÃ£o Paulo's autonomous drones team, where I fell in love with code that comes to life through sensors and actuators. There's nothing like developing software/firmware that will fly right in front of you!
</p>

<p>
    I'm currently developping my skills on firmware engineering, working mainly with freeRTOS, as well as IoT connectivity through webSockets.

### Here are some of my skills
